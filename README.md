Overview

The system is being designed to aid accountants to file their clients taxes. With the amount of complications and regulations increasing day by day, there is a need to reduce the manual labour in order to systematise the accountants work.

Based on the requirement, we are designing a Web based enterprise application that will allow an accountant to manage all his clients and provide a unified platform to gather the client’s information that he requires. It provides 2 different feature sets in terms of roles. They are:
The accountant
The client

The system will also include authentication mechanisms to ensure data security and privacy.

Use Cases

Features A (for accountants)
1. Accountants can log into the management system
2. Accountants can log out
3. Create, view and update own account details.
The accountant has a profile section which can be edited as and when required.
4. Create accounts for clients
The accountant will create accounts for clients and fill in the clients’ basic information.
5. Update clients’ details
The accountant will have the ability to update clients’ personal details after account creation.
6. Delete a client’s account if they are not working with the client anymore
The accountant may choose to remove a client’s account along with the associated details and documents from the system.
7. Create and manage (view, update, delete) file list templates
The accountant will create and manage file list templates for task creation.
8. Upload and manage documents in file list templates
The accountant may provide empty forms to the client to fill in.
9. Create, manage and assign tasks for clients
The accountant will create and assign tasks (created from file list templates) to clients, such as tax returns, audit, etc. based on the services that the client needs. (In each task, one or more documents need to be uploaded by the clients.)
10. View and download documents uploaded by the clients
The clients will receive a request (by email) to upload the required documents into their account, which can then be viewed and downloaded by the accountant.
11. Accountant can add notes or comments to a client's task
The comments can be for the accountants own reference, or pointers to a client for incomplete or incorrect documents/information.
12. Accountant can ask the client to provide extra documents for a task if necessary, e.g. some documents may need translation or certified copy.
13. Accountant can mark completed or uncompleted status for a client’s task.
The accountant can decide to flag a form as uncompleted in case not all the required documents and details have been provided. Since such scenarios depend from case to case, it is not automated.
14. When the task status is marked “completed”, accountant can upload a confirmation document for clients to sign.
15. Accountant can download the confirmation document signed by clients.

Features B (for clients)
1. Clients can log in based on credentials provided by the accountant.
2. Clients can log out.
3. Upload, view, update, delete documents
The client can upload, view, update, delete documents that required in the tasks.
4. View and download the documents that have been uploaded previously.
The client may have previously worked with the accountant. They can view and download their previous documents for reference or re-use.
